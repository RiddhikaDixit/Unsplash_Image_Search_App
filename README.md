# Unsplash_Image_Search_App
Introduction<br>
The project involves creating an Image Search App using React, a JavaScript 
library for building user interfaces. The application leverages a third-party API to 
search for and display images based on user input. It provides a practical use case 
for learning how to integrate APIs with React, manage state, and handle 
asynchronous operations in a real-world application.

The project demonstrates the ability to build a functional React application with 
real-time data fetching from an API. It showcases proficiency in React, API 
integration, state management, and responsive design. The final product is a fully 
functional Image Search App that meets the initial project objectives.
